## 1. Some Other Advanced Techniques

### A. Insertion Attack

**Definition:** Technique where an attacker confuses the IDS by forcing it to read invalid packets that the end system will not accept, but the IDS processes as valid.

#### Mechanism:
- **Invalid Packet Creation:** Craft packets that IDS accepts but target system rejects
- **State Desynchronization:** Create different interpretations between IDS and target
- **Protocol Exploitation:** Exploit differences in protocol implementations
- **Timing Manipulation:** Use timing differences in packet processing

#### Implementation Methods:
- **TTL Manipulation:** Set TTL values that expire before reaching target
- **Checksum Corruption:** Use invalid checksums that IDS ignores but target rejects
- **Protocol Violations:** Create packets that violate protocol standards
- **Fragmentation Abuse:** Use fragmentation to confuse packet reconstruction

#### Real-World Example:
```
Attacker → IDS → Target
Packet 1: Valid header, invalid payload (TTL expires at target)
Packet 2: Attack payload with correct TTL
Result: IDS sees combined benign traffic, target only sees attack
```

### B. Evasion

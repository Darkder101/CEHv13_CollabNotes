# Pulse Wave Attack

## Attack Classification
- **Category**: Volumetric Attack (Evasive)
- **OSI Layer**: Layer 3/4 (Network/Transport)
- **Protocol**: Any (TCP, UDP, ICMP)
- **Strategy**: Intermittent burst pattern

## Attack Mechanism
Uses **alternating attack and silence cycles** to evade DDoS detection systems and bypass automatic mitigation thresholds.

### How it Works:
1. **Attack Burst**: Send high-volume traffic for short period
2. **Silent Period**: Stop attack traffic completely
3. **Pattern Repeat**: Cycle between burst and silence
4. **Threshold Evasion**: Stay below sustained detection limits

## Key Characteristics
- **Intermittent Pattern**: ON/OFF attack cycles
- **Threshold Evasion**: Avoids triggering rate-based protections
- **Cumulative Damage**: Multiple small bursts cause overall disruption
- **Detection Difficulty**: Appears as traffic spikes, not sustained attack

## xam Focus Points

### Attack Timing:
- **Burst Duration**: 10-60 seconds of high traffic
- **Silent Duration**: 30-300 seconds of no attack traffic
- **Cycle Repetition**: Continuous ON/OFF pattern
- **Adaptive Timing**: Can adjust based on target response

### Common Exam Questions:
- **Q**: What is the primary goal of pulse wave attacks?
- **A**: To evade DDoS detection and mitigation systems
- **Q**: How does pulse wave attack differ from sustained DDoS?
- **A**: Uses intermittent bursts instead of continuous traffic
- **Q**: Why are pulse wave attacks difficult to detect?
- **A**: They stay below sustained traffic thresholds

### Detection Challenges:
- **Rate-based systems**: May not trigger on short bursts
- **Signature detection**: Intermittent traffic appears legitimate
- **Threshold systems**: Bursts may stay below limits
- **Human analysis**: May interpret as network congestion

## Attack Variations
- **Multi-vector Pulse**: Different attack types in each burst
- **Coordinated Pulse**: Multiple sources synchronized
- **Adaptive Pulse**: Timing adjusts to target defenses
- **Stealth Pulse**: Very short bursts with long pauses

## Detection & Mitigation
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Monitor traffic pattern anomalies
- **Cumulative Thresholds**: Track total traffic over time windows
- **Machine Learning**: Identify abnormal burst patterns
- **Proactive Blocking**: Block sources showing pulse behavior

### Detection Metrics:
- **Burst-to-baseline ratio**: High traffic spikes
- **Pattern regularity**: Consistent ON/OFF cycles
- **Source correlation**: Multiple sources with similar patterns
- **Service impact**: Degradation during burst periods

## Implementation Methods
- **Scripted Attacks**: Automated ON/OFF scheduling
- **Botnet Coordination**: Synchronized burst timing
- **Tool Integration**: LOIC/HOIC with timing controls
- **Custom Scripts**: Programmable burst patterns

## Why Effective?
- **Legacy Systems**: Older DDoS protection not designed for intermittent attacks
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Each burst still consumes target resources
- **Detection Gap**: Falls between automated and manual monitoring
- **Psychological Impact**: Unpredictable service disruption

## Attack Pattern Example

```

## Target Systems
- **Auto-scaling services**: Can't adapt to burst patterns
- **Rate-limited APIs**: Consume quota during bursts
- **Legacy firewalls**: Threshold-based detection only
- **CDN services**: May not cache during short bursts

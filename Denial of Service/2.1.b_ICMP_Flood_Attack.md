# ICMP Flood Attack

## Attack Classification
- **Category**: Volumetric Attack
- **OSI Layer**: Layer 3 (Network)
- **Protocol**: ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)

## Attack Mechanism
Overwhelms target with **massive ICMP Echo Requests** (ping packets), consuming bandwidth and processing resources.

### How it Works:
1. **Echo Requests**: Send continuous ICMP Echo Request packets
2. **Echo Replies**: Target responds with Echo Reply packets
3. **Bandwidth Saturation**: Incoming and outgoing traffic floods network
4. **Resource Exhaustion**: CPU cycles wasted processing ICMP

## Key Characteristics
- **Ping-based**: Uses legitimate ping protocol
- **Bidirectional Traffic**: Request + Reply = Double bandwidth usage
- **Large Packet Size**: Often uses maximum MTU (1500 bytes)
- **Easy Detection**: Visible in network monitoring tools

## Exam Focus Points

### Identification Symptoms:
- Extremely high ping response times
- Network congestion
- High ICMP traffic in monitoring tools
- Timeouts in legitimate services

### Common Exam Questions:
- **Q**: What ICMP type is used in ICMP flood attacks?
- **A**: Type 8 (Echo Request)
- **Q**: Why is ICMP flood effective?
- **A**: Creates bidirectional traffic (request + reply)

### Important Details:
- **ICMP Type 8**: Echo Request
- **ICMP Type 0**: Echo Reply  
- **Amplification Factor**: ~2x (request + response)

## Attack Variations
- **Ping of Death**: Oversized ICMP packets
- **ICMP Fragment Flood**: Fragmented ICMP packets
- **Directed Broadcast**: Using broadcast addresses

## Detection & Mitigation
- **ICMP Rate Limiting**: Limit ICMP packets per source
- **ICMP Filtering**: Block unnecessary ICMP types
- **Ingress/Egress Filtering**: Control ICMP flow
- **Upstream Protection**: ISP-level ICMP filtering

## Common Tools & Commands
- **ping**: `ping -f -s 65000 target_ip` (Linux flood ping)
- **hping3**: `hping3 -1 --flood target_ip`
- **Scapy**: Custom ICMP packet generation
- **Botnets**: Coordinated ICMP floods

## Defense Strategy
Most firewalls now **drop or limit ICMP** traffic by default, making this attack less effective than in the past.

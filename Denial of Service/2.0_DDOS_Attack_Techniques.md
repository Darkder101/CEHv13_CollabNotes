# Demonstrate Different DDoS Attack Techniques

---

## Basic Categories of DoS Attack Vectors

### 1. Volumetric Attacks
Consume bandwidth using massive traffic.

- **UDP Flood Attack**: Sends large numbers of UDP packets to random ports.
- **ICMP Flood Attack**: Overwhelms the target with ICMP Echo Requests (ping).
- **Ping of Death**: Sends malformed or oversized ping packets to crash systems.
- **Smurf Attack**: ICMP packets sent to broadcast IPs with spoofed source (victim), causing all replies to flood the victim.
- **Pulse Wave Attack**: Alternates between attack and silence to confuse mitigation systems.
- **Zero-day Attack**: Exploits unknown vulnerabilities to cause unexpected overloads.
- **Malformed IP Packet Flood**: Sends packets with bad headers, confusing the system.
- **Spoofed IP Packet Flood**: Uses fake IP addresses to send massive packets, hiding the real attacker.
- **NTP Amplification Attack**: Spoofs the victim’s IP to NTP servers which send huge replies, amplifying attack volume.

### 2. Protocol Attacks
Exhaust server resources by exploiting protocol weaknesses.

- **SYN Flood**: Sends repeated TCP connection requests without completing the handshake.
- **Fragmentation Attacks**: Send fragmented packets that overload reassembly processes.
- **Spoofed Session Floods**: Imitate existing sessions with fake data to confuse servers.
- **ACK Flood**: Sends fake ACK packets to flood firewall/state tables.
- **SYN-ACK Flood**: Overwhelms server with SYN-ACK replies (response to spoofed SYNs).
- **ACK and PUSH-ACK Floods**: Sends high volumes of TCP packets with ACK/PSH flags.
- **TCP Connection Flood**: Opens many connections, then holds them open.
- **TCP State Exhaustion**: Consumes all available TCP sessions/states on server/firewall.
- **RST Attacks**: Sends TCP Reset (RST) flags to tear down legitimate connections.
- **TCP SACK Panic Attack**: Exploits TCP Selective ACK (SACK) feature to crash Linux systems.

### 3. Application Layer Attacks
Target application processes and mimic normal traffic.

- **HTTP Flood Attack**: Floods the web server with legitimate-looking HTTP requests.
- **Slowloris Attack**: Opens many HTTP connections and sends headers slowly to exhaust resources.
- **UDP Application Layer Flood**: Sends malformed or high-volume app-level UDP packets.
- **DDoS Extortion Attack**: Threat of DDoS unless ransom is paid (ransom-based DDoS).

## DDoS Attack Toolkits

Used to automate DDoS attacks.

- **ISB**: Internet Security Booster – includes flooding tools
- **ultraDDOS-v2**: CLI-based DDoS launcher
- **LOIC** (Low Orbit Ion Cannon)
- **HOIC** (High Orbit Ion Cannon)
- **Botnets like Mirai**: Infect IoT devices for DDoS
- **RUDY** (R-U-Dead-Yet): Slow HTTP POST DDoS
- **Xerxes**: DDoS tool targeting web servers

## ✅ Quick Tip for CEH Exam

1. **Three Categories of DDoS Attacks**:
   - **Volumetric**: Bandwidth exhaustion (e.g., UDP, ICMP flood)
   - **Protocol**: Exploit network stack (e.g., SYN, ACK floods)
   - **Application Layer**: Target app logic (e.g., HTTP flood)

2. **Key Attack Vectors**:
   - **Smurf**: Uses ICMP broadcast
   - **Slowloris**: Slow header sends to tie up server
   - **NTP Amplification**: Response > Request size (amplification)

3. **SYN Flood vs. TCP State Exhaustion**:
   - SYN Flood: Incomplete handshakes
   - TCP State Exhaustion: Overwhelms connection tracking

4. **DDoS Toolkits**:
   - **LOIC/HOIC**: Easy to use, common in amateur attacks
   - **Mirai**: IoT-based botnet for large-scale attacks

5. **Zero-Day DDoS**:
   - Unexpected, often unmitigated due to new vulnerabilities

6. **Remember**:
   - DDoS can be blended: multiple vectors at once
   - Application-layer attacks often bypass basic filters

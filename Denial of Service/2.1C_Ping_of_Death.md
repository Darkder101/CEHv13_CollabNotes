# Ping of Death (PoD)

## Attack Classification
- **Category**: Volumetric Attack (Historical)
- **OSI Layer**: Layer 3 (Network)
- **Protocol**: ICMP + IP Fragmentation
- **Era**: Primarily 1990s (Legacy systems vulnerable)

## Attack Mechanism
Sends **oversized ICMP packets** that exceed the maximum IP packet size (65,535 bytes), causing system crashes or buffer overflows when reassembled.

### How it Works:
1. **Oversized Packet**: Create ICMP packet > 65,535 bytes
2. **Fragmentation**: IP layer fragments the oversized packet
3. **Reassembly**: Target attempts to reassemble fragments
4. **Buffer Overflow**: Reassembly process crashes the system

## Key Characteristics
- **Size Violation**: Exceeds maximum IP packet size
- **Fragment-based**: Uses IP fragmentation mechanism
- **System Crash**: Causes kernel panic or BSOD
- **Historical Impact**: Affected Windows 95, NT, some Unix systems

## Exam Focus Points

### Critical Details:
- **Maximum IP packet size**: 65,535 bytes
- **Typical PoD size**: 65,536+ bytes
- **Fragmentation required**: Too large for single packet
- **Result**: System crash, not just service disruption

### Common Exam Questions:
- **Q**: What is the maximum size of an IP packet?
- **A**: 65,535 bytes
- **Q**: What causes the system crash in Ping of Death?
- **A**: Buffer overflow during packet reassembly
- **Q**: Why is PoD considered historical?
- **A**: Modern systems have patched reassembly vulnerabilities

### Vulnerable Systems (Historical):
- Windows 95/98/NT
- Early Linux kernels
- Some network devices
- Legacy Unix systems

## Modern Context
- **Largely Patched**: Modern OS handle oversized packets safely
- **Still Relevant**: Some IoT devices remain vulnerable
- **Exam Importance**: Understanding packet fragmentation concepts

## Protection Methods
- **Input Validation**: Check packet sizes before processing
- **Fragment Filtering**: Drop suspicious fragmented packets
- **OS Updates**: Apply security patches
- **Firewalls**: Filter malformed packets

## Attack Tools (Historical)
- **ping**: `ping -l 65527 target_ip` (Windows)
- **Custom Tools**: Specially crafted packet generators
- **Teardrop**: Related fragmentation attack
- **Modern PoC**: Educational demonstrations

## Why Study This?
- **Fragmentation Understanding**: Learn IP fragmentation mechanics
- **Security History**: Understanding evolution of attacks
- **Exam Coverage**: Still appears in CEH curriculum
- **IoT Relevance**: Some embedded systems still vulnerable

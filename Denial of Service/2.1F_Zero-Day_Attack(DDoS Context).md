# Zero-Day Attack (DDoS Context)

## Attack Classification
- **Category**: Volumetric/Protocol/Application (Any Layer)
- **OSI Layer**: Variable (depends on vulnerability)
- **Protocol**: Any vulnerable protocol/service
- **Timeline**: Pre-patch exploitation

## Attack Mechanism
Exploits **unknown vulnerabilities** in systems, protocols, or applications to cause service disruption before patches or signatures are available.

### How it Works:
1. **Vulnerability Discovery**: Find unknown flaw in system/protocol
2. **Exploit Development**: Create method to trigger vulnerability
3. **Attack Deployment**: Use exploit to cause DoS condition
4. **Detection Evasion**: No signatures exist for unknown attack

## Key Characteristics
- **Unknown Vector**: No prior knowledge or defense exists
- **High Success Rate**: Targets have no specific protection
- **Limited Window**: Effective until vulnerability is discovered/patched
- **Sophisticated**: Usually requires advanced technical knowledge

## Exam Focus Points

### Zero-Day Lifecycle:
1. **Discovery**: Vulnerability found by attacker
2. **Exploitation**: Attack method developed
3. **Deployment**: Attack launched against targets
4. **Detection**: Security community discovers attack
5. **Mitigation**: Patches and signatures developed
6. **Obsolescence**: Attack becomes known and blocked

### Common Exam Questions:
- **Q**: What makes zero-day attacks particularly dangerous?
- **A**: No existing defenses or signatures available
- **Q**: How long is a zero-day attack effective?
- **A**: Until the vulnerability is discovered and patched
- **Q**: Why are zero-day attacks difficult to detect?
- **A**: They use unknown attack vectors with no signatures

### Key Concepts:
- **Zero-Day**: 0 days since vulnerability disclosure
- **CVE**: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures database
- **Responsible Disclosure**: Reporting vulns to vendors first
- **Bug Bounty**: Programs rewarding vulnerability discovery

## DDoS-Specific Zero-Days

### Historical Examples:
- **TCP SACK Panic** (2019): Linux kernel crash via TCP options
- **FragmentSmack** (2018): IP fragmentation DoS
- **KRACK** (2017): WiFi protocol weakness
- **Heartbleed** (2014): OpenSSL memory disclosure (could cause DoS)

### Attack Categories:
- **Protocol Flaws**: Weakness in network protocols
- **Implementation Bugs**: Errors in software implementation  
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Novel ways to consume resources
- **State Confusion**: Cause systems to enter invalid states

## Defense Strategies
- **Behavioral Monitoring**: Detect unusual traffic patterns
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify deviations from normal behavior
- **Rate Limiting**: Generic protection against volume-based attacks
- **Rapid Response**: Quick patching when vulnerabilities disclosed

### Proactive Measures:
- **Security Research**: Internal vulnerability assessment
- **Threat Intelligence**: Monitor for new attack discoveries
- **Incident Response**: Rapid containment and mitigation
- **Vendor Relationships**: Quick access to security patches

## Detection Methods
- **Traffic Analysis**: Monitor for unusual packet patterns
- **System Monitoring**: Watch for unexpected resource usage
- **Log Analysis**: Look for anomalous system behavior
- **Network Forensics**: Deep packet inspection for novel attacks

## Business Impact
- **High Damage Potential**: No existing protections
- **Reputation Risk**: Being victim of sophisticated attack
- **Recovery Time**: Longer due to unknown attack vector
- **Cost**: Emergency response and rapid patching

## Zero-Day vs Known Attacks
| Aspect | Zero-Day | Known Attack |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| Detection | Difficult | Signature-based |
| Prevention | Limited | Established defenses |
| Success Rate | High | Lower |
| Cost to Attacker | High | Low |
| Response Time | Slow | Automated |

## Vulnerability Scanning Techniques

Vulnerability scanning involves using automated or manual tools to identify weaknesses in systems, networks, applications, and devices. Below are various types of vulnerability scans:

---

### 1. External Scanning
- Identify open ports and related services on external networks  
- Examine the patch levels on the server  
- Examine the web applications  

### 2. Internal Scanning
- Check router configurations and firewall rules  
- Detect internal vulnerabilities of OS and servers  
- Scan for Trojans  
- Detect malware, spyware, and virus activity  
- Evaluate physical security  
- Check file-sharing mechanisms  

### 3. Host-Based Scanning
- Configuration-level examinations  
- System configurations  
- User directories  
- File systems  
- Registry settings  

### 4. Network-Based Scanning
- Detect missing patches  
- Identify unnecessary services  
- Check for weak authentication  
- Check for weak encryption  
- Examine router filtering rules  

### 5. Application Scanning

### 6. Database Scanning

### 7. Wireless Scanning

### 8. Distributed Scanning

### 9. Credential / Authentication Scanning

### 10. Manual Scanning

### 11. Automated Scanning

### 12. Cloud-Based Scanning

### 13. Mobile Application Scanning

### 14. Physical Security Vulnerability Scanning

### 15. IoT Devices Vulnerability Scanning

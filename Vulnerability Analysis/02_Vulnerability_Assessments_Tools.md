# Use Vulnerability Assessment Tools

Vulnerability assessment tools are essential in identifying weaknesses across networks, systems, and applications. Choosing the right tool and approach improves efficiency, accuracy, and remediation speed.

## 🔹 Comparing Approaches to Vulnerability Assessments

Different approaches offer different scanning logic and data collection techniques:

### 🔸 Product-Based Solutions
- Installed software or appliances.
- Operated by internal IT/security teams.
- Example: Nessus, GFI LanGuard.

### 🔸 Service-Based Solutions
- Third-party or MSSP-managed services.
- Often cloud-based; no internal installation.
- Example: Qualys Cloud Platform.

### 🔸 Tree-Based Solutions
- Uses attack tree logic to simulate exploit paths.
- Checks for vulnerability presence using decision trees.

### 🔸 Inference-Based Solutions
- Deduces vulnerability existence by analyzing system behavior and responses.
- May not directly test vulnerabilities.

## 🔹 Characteristics of Good Vulnerability Assessment Solutions

- Easy to deploy and use.
- High detection rate, low false positives.
- Regularly updated vulnerability database.
- Customizable scan scope and depth.
- Good reporting and remediation guidance.
- Support for compliance standards (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, etc.).

## 🔹 Working of Vulnerability Scanning Solutions

These tools follow a systematic process:

1. **Locating Nodes:**
   - Discover active IP addresses, hosts, and network nodes.

2. **Service and OS Discovery:**
   - Identify open ports, running services, software versions, and OS types.

3. **Testing for Known Vulnerabilities:**
   - Match against databases (CVE, NVD) to find exploitable weaknesses.

## 🔹 Types of Vulnerability Assessment Tools

Classified based on target, depth, and functionality:

### 🔸 Host-Based Vulnerability Assessment Tools
- Runs on the target system itself.
- Detects local misconfigurations, unpatched software, registry issues.
- Example: GFI LanGuard.

### 🔸 Depth Assessment Tools
- Deep scanning with high detail.
- Focused on specific systems or high-value assets.

### 🔸 Application-Layer Vulnerability Assessment Tools
- Targets web and application layers.
- Finds flaws like XSS, SQLi, insecure headers, etc.
- Example: Nikto, Burp Suite.

### 🔸 Scope Assessment Tools
- Allow scanning specific areas (e.g., internal vs external).
- Useful for compliance scans or segment-wise audits.

### 🔸 Active and Passive Tools
- **Active:** Actively send probes to identify issues (e.g., Nessus).
- **Passive:** Observe traffic silently to detect vulnerabilities (e.g., Wireshark-based monitoring).

### 🔸 Location and Data Examination Tools

#### ▪️ Network-Based Scanner
- Scans devices from a central point.
- Detects open ports, OS, services.
- Example: Nessus, OpenVAS.

#### ▪️ Agent-Based Scanner
- Small agents run locally on endpoints.
- Provide deeper visibility into installed apps, registry, configs.

#### ▪️ Proxy Scanner
- Operates via a proxy to reach internal segments or hidden networks.

#### ▪️ Cluster Scanner
- Scales across many nodes to scan large networks efficiently.

## 🔹 Choosing the Right Vulnerability Assessment Tool

When selecting a tool, consider:
- Target environment (cloud, IoT, enterprise, app).
- Real-time vs scheduled scans.
- Budget and licensing (open-source vs commercial).
- Integration with patching or ticketing systems.
- Compliance and reporting capabilities.

## 🔹 Remediate Vulnerabilities

After detection, remediation is key:
- Prioritize based on CVSS score and business impact.
- Patch unpatched systems.
- Change weak configurations or access controls.
- Monitor for re-exploitation or persistence.

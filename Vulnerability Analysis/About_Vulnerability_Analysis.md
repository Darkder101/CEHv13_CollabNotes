# Vulnerability Analysis


A hacker needs to have knowledge about the following areas:

- **Vulnerability Classification**
- **Various Vulnerability Scanning Techniques**
- **Vulnerability Scoring Systems**
- **Vulnerability Database**
- **Vulnerability Management Life-Cycle**

## Vulnerability Classification

| Vulnerability Type              | Description                                                 | Examples                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Misconfiguration / Weak Configuration** | If configuration is not correct                            | **Network Misconfiguration**: insecure protocols, open ports  <br> **Host Misconfiguration**: open permissions, open root account |
| **Application Flaws**           | Vulnerabilities in application exploited by an attacker     | Buffer overflow, memory leaks, DLL injection, race conditions, improper input handling, integer overflow |
| **Poor Patch Management**       | Unpatched software can make an application vulnerable        | Unpatched servers, unpatched firmware, unpatched OS                      |
| **Design Flaw**                 | Logical flaws in the functionality of the system             | Incorrect encryption, poor validation of data                            |
| **Third-Party Risks**           | Third-party services having access to privileged systems     | Vendor management, supply-chain risks, outsourced code development       |

## Notes

Ensure you understand how each vulnerability category can be exploited, how to detect it using scanning tools, and how to score and manage it using industry-standard systems such as CVSS, NVD, and the vulnerability management lifecycle.

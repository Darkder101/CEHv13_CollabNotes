## Common Vulnerability Scoring Systems and Databases

The following are widely used vulnerability scoring systems and databases:

- **Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)**
- **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)**
- **National Vulnerability Database (NVD)**
- **Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)**

---

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

CVSS is composed of four metric groups:

- **Base Metric**: Exploitability metric, Impact metric  
- **Threat Metric**
- **Environmental Metric**
- **Supplemental Metric**

### CVSS Severity Ratings

| Severity   | Base Score Range |
|------------|------------------|
| **None**   | 0.0              |
| **Low**    | 0.1 – 3.9        |
| **Medium** | 4.0 – 6.9        |
| **High**   | 7.0 – 8.9        |
| **Critical** | 9.0 – 10.0     |

These systems help organizations prioritize vulnerability remediation based on risk, exposure, and impact.

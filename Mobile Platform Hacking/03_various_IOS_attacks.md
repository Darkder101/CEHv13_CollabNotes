- **Attack Vector**: Exploits vulnerabilities in the boot process
- **Examples**: Checkm8 bootrom exploit used by checkra1n
- **Advantages**: Early execution before security measures load
- **Persistence**: Survives system reboots but may require re-exploitation
- **Impact**: Provides deep system access and control

#### Bootrom Exploit
- **Description**: Exploits vulnerabilities in hardware-level boot code
- **Target**: Immutable boot code stored in device hardware
- **Characteristics**: Cannot be patched via software updates
- **Examples**: Limera1n, checkm8 (iPhone X and earlier)
- **Advantages**: Permanent exploit that cannot be patched
- **Limitations**: Hardware-specific, affects only certain device generations

- **Process**: Must run jailbreak tool connected to computer for each restart
- **Risk**: Device unusable if computer unavailable during boot issues
- **Examples**: Early iPhone jailbreaks and some modern beta tools
- **Practicality**: Limited practical use due to computer dependency

### Semi-Untethered Jailbreaking
- **Definition**: Jailbreak persists through reboot but requires app-based re-activation
- **Boot Process**: Device boots normally with jailbreak disabled
- **Re-activation**: On-device app restores jailbreak functionality
- **Examples**: Unc0ver, Taurine jailbreaks
- **Convenience**: No computer required for re-activation
- **Current Trend**: Most common approach for modern iOS jailbreaking

## Introduction to Mobile Platform Attacks

Mobile platform attacks represent a critical security domain in modern cybersecurity. With billions of mobile devices worldwide, these platforms have become prime targets for cybercriminals. 75% of Mobile Apps Fail Basic Security Tests. Hackers are increasingly focusing on the mobile channel, making mobile apps a prime target for fraud and security breaches.

Mobile platforms encompass smartphones, tablets, wearables, and IoT devices running operating systems like Android, iOS, Windows Mobile, and embedded systems. The attack surface includes the device hardware, operating system, applications, network communications, and backend infrastructure.

# Explain Application-Level Session Hijacking

Application-level hijacking attacks the **logic of web/app session management** â€” stealing cookies, predicting tokens, or exploiting browser flaws.

---

## ðŸ”¹ a. Session Sniffing

Captures network traffic to find session identifiers.

- Works best on unencrypted HTTP.
- Tools: Wireshark, Bettercap.
- **Real-world**: Attacker on the same Wi-Fi network sniffs cookies.

---

### Compromising Session IDs using Sniffing

- Search captured packets for `Set-Cookie` headers or URL parameters.
- Inject stolen token into attackerâ€™s browser (cookie editor extensions).

---

## ðŸ”¹ b. Predictable Session Tokens

If tokens are generated poorly, attackers can **predict** them.

### 1) Analyzing Token Patterns
- **Sequential IDs**: Increment numbers (e.g., 1001, 1002).
- **Timestamp IDs**: Generated from server time; predictable.

### 2) Brute Force Attacks
- **Small Token Space**: Few possibilities = quick guessing.
- **No Rate Limiting**: Unlimited tries without blocking.

### 3) Weak Random Number Generators
- Bad PRNG â†’ attacker can generate same token sequence.

## ðŸ”¹ c. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)

- Attacker intercepts traffic between user and server.
- Can inject JavaScript to steal cookies.

---

## ðŸ”¹ d. Man-in-the-Browser (MITB)

- Malware inside browser modifies data in real time.
- Bypasses HTTPS since it happens after decryption.

---

## ðŸ”¹ e. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

- Injects malicious scripts into web pages.
- Script reads cookies (`document.cookie`) and sends to attacker.

---

## ðŸ”¹ f. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

- Tricks authenticated users into sending malicious requests.
- Example: Auto-submitting a hidden form to transfer funds.

---

## ðŸ”¹ g. Session Replay Attack

- Capture â†’ Store â†’ Replay session traffic to impersonate a user.
- Works if server doesnâ€™t expire tokens after first use.

---

## ðŸ”¹ h. Session Fixation Attack

- Attacker sets a known session ID before victim logs in.
- Victim authenticates â†’ attacker reuses token.

---

## ðŸ”¹ i. CRIME Attack

- Exploits HTTP compression in HTTPS to leak token data.

---

## ðŸ”¹ j. Session Hijacking via Proxy Server

- Victim routes through malicious proxy â†’ attacker sees everything.

---

## ðŸ”¹ k. Forbidden Attack

- Using stolen token to access restricted pages.

---

## ðŸ”¹ l. Session Donation Attack

- Victim intentionally shares session with someone else.
- Often used in insider threats.

---

## Quick Tip for CEH Exam (with explanations):

- **Predictable token** = look for sequential/timestamp IDs.
- **MITM vs MITB**: MITM is network-level; MITB is local to victimâ€™s browser.
- **Session Fixation**: Attacker controls token before login.
- **CRIME**: Related to HTTPS + compression vulnerabilities.

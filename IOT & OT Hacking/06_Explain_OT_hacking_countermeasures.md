# OT Hacking Countermeasures

## Network Security Countermeasures

### Network Segmentation and Zoning

Network segmentation is the foundation of OT security architecture.

#### Zone-Based Security Architecture
- **Level 0-1 (Control Zone)**: Field devices and basic control systems
  - Air-gapped or highly restricted connectivity
  - Dedicated network infrastructure
  - Industrial protocols only
- **Level 2 (Supervisory Zone)**: HMI and supervisory control systems
  - Limited connectivity to upper levels
  - Protocol gateways and data diodes
  - Monitoring and logging systems
- **Level 3 (Operations Zone)**: Manufacturing execution systems
  - Controlled connectivity to business networks
  - Application-layer firewalls
  - Identity and access management
- **Level 4-5 (Enterprise Zone)**: Business and planning systems
  - Standard enterprise security controls
  - Integration with corporate IT security

#### Industrial Firewalls
Specialized firewalls designed for OT environments:
- **Stateful Inspection**: Deep packet inspection for industrial protocols
- **Application Layer Control**: Understanding of industrial protocol semantics
- **High Availability**: Redundant configurations for critical systems
- **Fail-Safe Operation**: Fail-open or fail-closed based on safety requirements

#### Network Access Control (NAC)
- **Device Authentication**: Certificate-based device authentication
- **Asset Discovery**: Automatic discovery and classification of OT devices
- **Policy Enforcement**: Dynamic policy application based on device type
- **Quarantine Capabilities**: Isolation of non-compliant or suspicious devices

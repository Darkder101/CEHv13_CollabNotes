## How a Sniffer Works

### ðŸ”¹ Core Workflow
1. **NIC enters Promiscuous Mode**
2. Captures **all packets** on the network segment
3. Forwards packets to the **sniffer application** (e.g., Wireshark)
4. Analyst or attacker **inspects captured traffic**

### ðŸ”¹ NIC Modes
- **Normal Mode**: Captures packets only **addressed to its MAC**
- **Promiscuous Mode**: Captures **all broadcast and unicast** traffic on the network

### ðŸ”¹ OSI Model Level
- Operates at **Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)**
- Can see Ethernet frames, MAC addresses, and payload

### ðŸ”¹ Requirements
- Works **passively** on hubs and Wi-Fi
- Needs **active sniffing techniques** on switches (e.g., ARP poisoning, MAC flooding)

### ðŸ”¹ Tools That Use This
- `Wireshark`, `tcpdump`, `Ettercap`, `Kismet`

> ðŸ§  **CEH Tip**: Remember â€“ Sniffers donâ€™t alter traffic; they just **observe** it. But enabling promiscuous mode is essential to capture beyond the hostâ€™s traffic.

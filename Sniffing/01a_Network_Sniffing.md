## Network Sniffing

### üîπ Definition
- The process of **monitoring and capturing network packets** as they travel over a network.

### üîπ Purpose
- **Legitimate**: Network troubleshooting and performance analysis  
- **Malicious**: Intercept sensitive data (e.g., credentials, session tokens)

### üîπ How It Works
- Requires placing the **Network Interface Card (NIC)** in **promiscuous mode**
- Promiscuous mode = NIC captures **all packets**, not just those addressed to it

### üîπ Key Exam Points
- Works at **OSI Layer 2** (Data Link Layer)
- Used in both **passive** and **active** sniffing techniques
- Common tools: `Wireshark`, `tcpdump`, `Ettercap`
- Crucial for attacks like:
  - Password interception
  - Session hijacking
  - ARP/DNS spoofing

# Summarize Social Engineering

Social Engineering is the art of manipulating people to give up confidential information or perform actions that compromise security — often bypassing technical controls by exploiting **human psychology**.

---

## 🔹 What is Social Engineering?

It’s a **non-technical attack** that tricks users into giving access or revealing sensitive data by preying on emotions like trust, fear, urgency, or curiosity.

---

### 🔸 Common Targets of Social Engineering

- **Employees (esp. new or junior staff)** – Less trained or eager to help.
- **Help Desk / Customer Service** – Often willing to reset passwords or share info.
- **HR Department** – Handles sensitive employee data.
- **IT Support** – Holds admin-level access to systems.
- **Third-party Vendors** – May have backdoor access but less security training.

---

### 🔸 Impact of Social Engineering

- **Unauthorized Access** to networks, accounts, or systems.
- **Data Breaches** – Exfiltration of sensitive info (PII, credentials).
- **Reputation Damage** – Loss of trust in the company.
- **Financial Loss** – Through fraud, scams, or ransomware.
- **Bypasses security controls** that software may otherwise block.

## 🔹 Behaviors Vulnerable to Attack

Attackers exploit these **psychological triggers**:

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Authority** | Pretending to be a boss or official to pressure victims. |
| **Intimidation** | Using fear or threats (e.g., legal threats, account termination). |
| **Consensus/Social Proof** | Saying “others have done it” to create peer pressure. |
| **Scarcity** | “Limited time” or “only a few left” to rush decisions. |
| **Urgency** | “Act now or risk being locked out!” — forces rash actions. |
| **Familiarity/Liking** | Builds rapport or acts friendly to lower defenses. |
| **Trust** | Masquerading as a trusted source (e.g., IT, bank). |
| **Greed** | Offering fake rewards (lottery, free gifts) to lure victims. |

## 🔹 Factors That Make Companies Vulnerable

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Insufficient Security Training** | Employees unaware of threats like phishing. |
| **Unregulated Access to Info** | Sensitive data is too freely accessible. |
| **Multiple Organization Units** | Large companies = harder coordination = more gaps. |
| **Lack of Security Policies** | No rules means no accountability or awareness. |

## 🔹 Phases of a Social Engineering Attack

1. **Research the Target Company**
   - Gather info (from LinkedIn, websites, job boards).
   - Identify weak spots (vendors, email patterns, HR contacts).

2. **Select a Target**
   - Choose a person or department based on ease and access potential.

3. **Develop a Relationship**
   - Contact via email, phone, or in-person.
   - Gain trust through impersonation or pretext.

4. **Exploit the Relationship**
   - Ask for credentials, send malware, or get physical access.

## 🔹 Types of Social Engineering

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Human-Based** | In-person methods (tailgating, impersonation, dumpster diving). |
| **Computer-Based** | Uses tech (phishing emails, pop-ups, fake websites). |
| **Mobile-Based** | Vishing (voice phishing), smishing (SMS phishing), fake apps. |

## Quick Tip for CEH Exam (with explanations):

- **Remember: Social engineering = hacking the human, not the machine.**  
  → Questions may frame it as “non-technical method” or “emotional manipulation.”

- **Know which behaviors are being exploited — especially Authority, Urgency, Trust.**  
  → These appear in almost every real-world attack. Recognizing them helps identify likely exam options.

- **Understand phases of the attack.**  
  → Know the flow: Recon → Relationship → Exploit. It's a common exam pattern.

- **Types are tested: human-based vs. computer-based. Know examples.**  
  → Human: tailgating, impersonation. Computer: phishing. Mobile: vishing, smishing.

- **Don’t confuse impacts and factors.**  
  → *Impacts* = what happens after attack (data loss, breach).  
     *Factors* = what makes you vulnerable (poor training, access control gaps).

- **CEH loves to ask about familiarity/liking and scarcity – watch for psychological triggers in scenario-based questions.**  
  → If someone’s “being friendly” or says “limited offer,” that’s **social proof or scarcity** in play.

## Quick Tip for CEH Exam:

  ‚Üí Look for scenarios where help desks are manipulated by phone.

- **Tailgating vs. Piggybacking:**  
  ‚Üí *Tailgating* = no permission. *Piggybacking* = with permission.

- **Shoulder surfing & eavesdropping = passive info gathering.**  
  ‚Üí No direct interaction, just observation.

- **Dumpster diving may appear in scenarios about old documents or USBs.**  
  ‚Üí It's legal in many places if trash is outside premises!
